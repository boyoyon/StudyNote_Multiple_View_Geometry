<p>
Carlsson [Carlsson-95] と Weinshall ら [Weinshall-95] の研究以来、複数のカメラから観測される点とカメラ中心の役割を入れ替えることを可能にする双対化原理が存在することが知られています。原理的には、これは射影再構成アルゴリズムを双対化することで新しいアルゴリズムを得る可能性を意味します。本章では、このテーマを展開し、任意の射影再構成アルゴリズムを双対化する明示的な手法を概説します。しかしながら、実際の実装レベルでは、この双対化手法を適用して実用的なアルゴリズムを生成するためには、克服すべき困難があることがわかります。
<!-- It has been known since the work of Carlsson [Carlsson-95] and Weinshall et al.
[Weinshall-95] that there is a dualization principle that allows one to interchange the
role of points being viewed by several cameras and the camera centres themselves. In
principle this implies the possibility of dualizing projective reconstruction algorithms
to obtain new algorithms. In this chapter, this theme is developed to outline an explicit
method for dualizing any projective reconstruction algorithm. At the practical
implementation level, however, it is shown that there are difficulties which need to be
overcome in order to allow application of this dualization method to produce working
algorithms. -->

ここで、行列 \(P\) を持つカメラを考えてみましょう。カメラの中心 \(C\) はどの軸平面にも乗らない、つまり \(C\) の4つの座標のいずれも0ではないと仮定します。
この場合、点 \(P \mathbf E_i\; i = 1, . . . , 4\) のうち3つは画像内で同一線上にありません。
したがって、画像に射影変換 \(H\) を適用して \(\mathbf e_i =HP\mathbf E_i\) とすることができます。これは既に行われているものと仮定し、以降 \(HP\) を単に \(P\) と表記します。
\(P\mathbf E_i = \mathbf e_i\) であるため、行列 \(P\) の形は次のようになります。

<!-- Now, consider a camera with matrix \(P\). We assume that the camera centre \(C\) does
not sit on any of the axial planes, that is none of the four coordinates of \(C\) is zero.
In this case, no three of the points \(P \mathbf E_i\; for i = 1, . . . , 4\) are collinear in the image.
Consequently, one may apply a projective transformation H to the image so that \(\mathbf e_i =HP\mathbf E_i\). We assume that this has been done, and henceforth denote \(HP\) simply by \(P\). Since
\(P\mathbf E_i = \mathbf e_i\), the form of the matrix \(P\) is
P =

The interchange of the roles of cameras and points may be interpreted as a form of duality,
which will be referred to as Carlsson–Weinshall duality, or more briefly Carlsson
duality. The consequences of this duality will be explored in the rest of this chapter.
20.1.1 Dual algorithms
First of all, we will use it for deriving a dual algorithm from a given projective reconstruction
algorithm. Specifically, it will be shown that if one has an algorithm for doing
projective reconstruction from n views of m + 4 points, then there is an algorithm for
doing projective reconstruction from m views of n+4 points. This result, observed by
Carlsson [Carlsson-95], will be made specific by explicitly describing the steps of the
dual algorithm.
We consider a projective reconstruction problem, which will be referred to as
P(m, n). It is the problem of doing reconstruction from m views of n points. We
denote image points by xi
j , which represents the image of the j-th object space point
in the i-th view. Thus, the upper index indicates the view number, and the lower index
represents the point number. Such a set of points {xi
j} is called realizable if there are a
set of camera matrices Pi and a set of 3D points Xj such that xi
j = PiXj . The projective
reconstruction problem P(m, n) is that of finding such camera matrices Pi and points
Xj given a realizable set {xi
j} for m views of n points. The set of camera matrices and
3D points together are called a realization (or projective realization) of the set of point
correspondences.
Let A(n,m + 4) represent an algorithm for solving the projective reconstruction
problem P(n,m + 4). An algorithm will now be exhibited for solving the projective
reconstruction P(m, n + 4). This algorithm will be denoted A∗(m, n + 4), the dual of
the algorithm A(n,m + 4).
Initially, the steps of the algorithm will be given without proof. In addition, difficulties
will be glossed over so as to give the general idea without getting bogged down in
details. In the description of this algorithm it is important to keep track of the range of
the indices, and whether they index the cameras or the points. Thus, the following may
help to keep track.

The dual algorithm
Given an algorithm A(n,m + 4) the goal is to exhibit a dual algorithm A∗(m, n + 4).
Input:
The input to the algorithm A∗(m, n+4) consists of a realizable set of n+4 points seen
in m views. This set of points can be arranged in a table as in figure 20.1(left).
In this table, the points xi
n+k are separated from the other points xi
j , since they will
receive special treatment.
Step 1: Transform
The first step is to compute, for each i, a transformation Ti that maps the points
xi
n+k, k = 1, . . . , 4 in the i-th view to the points ek of a canonical basis for projective
2-space IP2. The transformation Ti is applied also to each of the points xi
j to produce
transformed points x′i
j = Tixi
j . The result is the transformed point array shown
in figure 20.1(right). A different transformation Ti is computed and applied to each
column of the array, as indicated.

Fig. 20.2. Left: Transposed data. Right: Transposed data extended by addition of extra points.
Step 2: Transpose
The last four rows of the array are dropped, and the remaining block of the array is
transposed. One defines ˆxj
i = x′i
j . At the same time, one does a mental switch of
points and views. Thus the point ˆxj
i is now conceived as being the image of the i-th
point in the j-th view, whereas the point x′i
j was the image of the j-th point in the i-th
view. What is happening here effectively is that the roles of points and cameras are
being swapped – the basic concept behind Carlsson duality expressed by (20.2). The
resulting transposed array is shown in figure 20.2(left).
Step 3: Extend
The array of points is now extended by the addition of four extra rows containing points
ek in all positions of the (m + k)-th row of the array, as shown in figure 20.2(right).
The purpose of this extension will be explained in section 20.1.2.
Step 4: Solve
The array of points resulting from the last step has m+4 rows and n columns, and may
be regarded as the positions of m+ 4 points seen in n views. As such, it is a candidate
for solution by the algorithm A(n,m + 4), which we have assumed is given. Essential
here is that the points in the array form a realizable set of point correspondences. Justification
of this is deferred for now. The result of the algorithm A(n,m + 4) is a set
of cameras ˆP
j
and points bXi such that ˆxj
i = ˆP
j bXi. In addition, corresponding to the last
four rows of the array, there are points bXm+k such that ek = ˆP
j bXm+k for all j.
Step 5: 3D transformation
Since the reconstruction obtained in the last step is a projective reconstruction, one may
transform it (equivalently, choose a projective coordinate frame) such that the points
506 20 Duality
bXm+k are the four points Ek of a partial canonical basis for IP3. The only requirement
is that the points bXm+k obtained in the projective reconstruction are not coplanar. This
assumption is validated later.
At this point, one sees that ek = ˆP
j bXm+k = ˆP
j
Ek. From this it follows that ˆP
j
has
the special form
ˆP
j
=

aj dj
bj dj
cj dj

. (20.3)
Step 6: Dualize
Let bXi = (Xi, Yi, Zi, Ti)T, and ˆP
j
be as given in (20.3). Now define points
Xj = (aj , bj , cj , dj)T and cameras
P′i =

Xi Ti
Yi Ti
Zi Ti

.
Then one verifies that
P′iXj = (Xiaj + Tidj , Yibj + Tidj , Zicj + Tidj)T
= ˆP
j bXi
= ˆxj
i
= x′i
j .
If, in addition, one defines Xn+k = Ek for k = 1, . . . , 4, then P′iXn+k = ek. It is then
evident that the cameras P′i and points Xj and Xn+k form a projective realization of the
transformed data array obtained in step 1 of this algorithm.
Step 7: Reverse transformation
Finally, defining Pi = (Ti)−1P′i, and with the points Xj and Xn+k obtained in the
previous step, one has a projective realization of the original data. Indeed, one verifies
PiXj = (Ti)−1P′iXj = (Ti)−1x′i
j = xi
j .
This completes the description of the algorithm. One can see that it takes place in
various stages.
(i) In step 1, the data is transformed into canonical image reference frames based
on the selection of four distinguished points.
(ii) In steps 2 and 3 the problem is mapped into the dual domain, resulting in a dual
problem P(n,m + 4).
(iii) The dual problem is solved in steps 4 and 5.
(iv) Step 6 maps the solution back into the original domain.
(v) Step 7 undoes the effects of the initial transformation.
20.1 Carlsson–Weinshall duality 507
20.1.2 Justification of the algorithm
To justify this algorithm, one needs to be sure that at step 4 there indeed exists a solution
to the transformed problem. Before considering this, it is necessary to explain the
purpose of step 3, which extends the data by the addition of rows of image points ek,
and step 5, which transforms the arbitrary projective solution to one in which four
points are equal to the 3D basis points Ek.
The purpose of these steps is to ensure that one obtains a solution to the dual reconstruction
problem in which ˆP
j
has the special form given by (20.3) in which the
camera matrix is parametrized by only 4 values. The dual algorithm is described in this
manner so that it will work with any algorithm A(n,m + 4) whatever. However, both
steps 3 and 5 may be eliminated if the known algorithm A(n,m+4) has the capability
of enforcing this constraint on the camera matrices directly. Algorithms based on the
fundamental matrix, trifocal or quadrifocal tensors may easily be modified in this way,
as will be seen.
In the mean time, since ˆP
j
of the form (20.3) is called a reduced camera matrix, we
call any reconstruction of a set of image correspondences in which each camera matrix
is of this form a reduced reconstruction. Not all sets of realizable point correspondences
allow a reduced realization, however. The following result characterizes sets of
point correspondences that do have this property.
Result 20.2. A set of image points {xi
j : i = 1, . . . ,m ; j = 1, . . . , n} admits a
reduced realization if and only if it may be augmented with supplementary correspondences
xi
n+k = ek for k = 1, . . . , 4 such that
(i) The total set of image correspondences is realizable, and
(ii) The reconstructed points Xn+k corresponding to the supplementary image correspondences
are non-coplanar.
Proof. The proof is straightforward enough. Suppose the set permits a reduced realization,
and let Pi be the set of reduced camera matrices. Let points Xn+k = Ek for
k = 1, . . . , 4 be projected into the m images. The projections are xi
n+k = PiXn+k =
PiEk = ek for all i.
Conversely, suppose the augmented set of points is realizable and the points Xn+k are
non-coplanar. In this case, a projective basis may be chosen such that Xn+k = Ek.
Then for each view, one has ek = PiEk for all k. From this it follows that each Pi has
the desired form (20.3).
One other remark must be made before proving the correctness of the algorithm.
Result 20.3. If a set of image points {xi
j : i = 1, . . . ,m ; j = 1, . . . , n} permits a
reduced realization then so does the transposed set {ˆxj
i : j = 1, . . . , n ; i = 1, . . . ,m}
where ˆxj
i = xi
j for all i and j.
This is the basic duality property, effectively proved by the construction given in step
6 of the algorithm above. Now it is possible to prove the correctness of the algorithm.
508 20 Duality
Result 20.4. Let xi
j and xi
n+k as in figure 20.1(left) be a set of realizable image point
correspondences, and suppose
(i) for each i, the four points xi
n+k do not include three collinear points.
(ii) the four points Xn+k in a projective reconstruction are non-coplanar.
Then the algorithm of section 20.1.1 will succeed.
Proof. Because of the first condition, transformations Ti exist for each i, transforming
the input data to the form shown in figure 20.1(right). This transformed data is also
realizable, since the transformed data differs only by a projective transformation of the
image.
Now, according to result 20.2 applied to figure 20.1(right), the correspondences x′i
j
admit a reduced realization. By result 20.3 the transposed data figure 20.2(left) also
admits a reduced realization. Applying result 20.2 once more shows that the extended
data figure 20.2(right) is realizable. Furthermore, the points bXm+k are non-coplanar,
and so step 5 is valid. The subsequent steps 6 and 7 go forward without problems.
The first condition may be checked from the image correspondences xi
j . It may be
thought that to check the second condition requires reconstruction to be carried out. It
is, however, possible to check whether the reconstructed points will be coplanar without
carrying out the reconstruction. This is left as an exercise for the reader (page 342).
20.2 Reduced reconstruction
In this section, we concentrate on and reevaluate steps 3 – 5 of the algorithm described
in the preceding section. To recapitulate, the purpose of these steps is to obtain a
reduced reconstruction from a set of image correspondences. Thus, the input is a set of
image correspondences ˆxj
i admitting a reduced realization (see figure 20.2(left)). The
output is a set of reduced camera matrices ˆP
j
and points bXi such that ˆP
j bXi = ˆxj
i for all
i, j.
As we have seen, one way to do this (as in steps 3 – 5) of the given algorithm is
to augment the points by the addition of four extra synthetic point correspondences
ˆxj
m+k, carrying out projective reconstruction, and then applying a 3D homography so
that the 3D points bXm+k are mapped to the points Ek of a projective basis for IP3. The
problem with this is that in the presence of noise, the projective reconstruction is not
exact. Thus, the camera matrices obtained by this method will map points Ek to points
close to, but not identical with ek. This means that the camera matrices are not exactly
in reduced form. Therefore, we now consider methods of computing a realization of
the point correspondences in which the cameras are exactly reduced.
20.2.1 The reduced fundamental matrix
The most evident applications of these dual methods are to dualize the reconstruction
algorithms involving the fundamental matrix and trifocal tensor. These will lead to
reconstruction algorithms for 6 or 7 points (respectively) across N views. In this section,
we consider reconstruction from 6 points. The dual of a reconstruction problem
20.2 Reduced reconstruction 509
P(N, 6) is a problem P(2,N + 4), namely reconstruction from N + 4 points in 2
views. The method of chapter 10 involving the fundamental matrix is a standard way
of solving such a problem.
To this end we define a reduced fundamental matrix:
Definition 20.5. A fundamental matrix ˆF is called a reduced fundamental matrix if it
satisfies the condition eT
i
ˆFei = 0 for i = 1, . . . , 4.
It is evident that since a reduced fundamental matrix already satisfies constraints
derived from four point correspondences, it may be computed from a small number of
additional points, in fact linearly from four points, or non-linearly from three points.
20.2.2 Computation of the reduced fundamental matrix
For a reduced fundamental matrix, the condition eT
i
ˆFei = 0 for i = 1, . . . , 3 implies
that the diagonal entries of ˆF are zero. The requirement that (1, 1, 1)ˆF(1, 1, 1)T = 0
gives the additional condition that the sum of entries of ˆF is zero. Thus one may write
ˆF in the form
ˆF =

0 p q
r 0 s
t −(p + q + r + s + t) 0

(20.4)
thereby parametrizing a fundamental matrix satisfying all the linear constraints (though
not the condition det ˆF = 0). Now, a further point correspondence x ↔ x′ satisfying
x′TˆFx = 0 is easily seen to provide a linear equation in the parameters p, . . . , t of
ˆF. Given at least four such correspondences, one may solve for these parameters, up
to an inconsequential scale. Given only three such correspondences, the extra constraint
det ˆF = 0 may be used to provide the extra constraint necessary to determine
ˆF. There may be one or three solutions. This computation is analogous to the method
used in section 11.1.2(p281) to compute the fundamental matrix from seven point correspondences.
With four correspondences xi ↔ x′
i or more, one finds a least-squares
solution.
20.2.3 Retrieving reduced camera matrices
Computing a pair of reduced camera matrices that correspond to a reduced fundamental
matrix is surprisingly tricky. One can not assume that the first camera is [I | 0] as
in the usual projective camera case, since this is non-generic, the camera centre corresponding
with the basis point E4 = (0, 0, 0, 1)T. However, we may instead assume that
the pair of cameras are of the form
P =

1 1
1 1
1 1

and P′ =

a d
b d
c d

(20.5)
since the centre of the first camera is (1, 1, 1, 1)T which is a generic point with respect
to the basis points E1, . . . , E4. Further, if d 6= 0, then we may assume that d = 1, but
we prefer not to do this.
510 20 Duality
The reduced fundamental matrix corresponding to this pair of cameras is
ˆF =

0 b(d − c) −c(d − b)
−a(d − c) 0 c(d − a)
a(d − b) −b(d − a) 0

(20.6)
which the reader may verify satisfies the four linear constraints as well as the zerodeterminant
condition. The task at hand is to retrieve the values of (a, b, c, d) given
the fundamental matrix. This seemingly requires a solution of simultaneous quadratic
equations, but there is a linear method as follows.
(i) The ratio a : b : c may be found by solving the set of homogeneous linear
equations

f12 f21 0
f13 0 f31
0 f23 f32

where fij is the ij-th entry of ˆF. The matrix appearing here clearly has the
same rank as ˆF (namely 2), so there is a unique solution (up to scale) to this
equation set. The solution a : b : c = A : B : C provides a set of homogeneous
equations in a, b and c, namely Ba = Ab, Ca = Ac and Cb = Bc, of which
two are linearly independent.
(ii) Similarly, one may find the ratio d − a : d − b : d − c by solving (d − a, d −
b, d − c)ˆF = 0. Once again, the solution is unique. This provides two more
linear equations in the values of a, b, c, d.
(iii) From the set of equations one may solve for (a, b, c, d) up to scale, and hence
reconstruct the second camera matrix according to (20.5).
20.2.4 Solving for six points in three views
The minimal case involving the computation of the reduced fundamental matrix involves
three point, in which case there may be three solutions. By dualization, this
leads to a solution to the reconstruction problem for six points in three views. Its use in
outlier detection using the trifocal tensor has been described in algorithm 16.4(p401).
Because of its intrinsic interest as a minimum-case solution, and because of its practical
use, the algorithm is given explicitly as algorithm 20.1. The algorithm consists
essentially of putting together what has been described previously. However there are
a few minor variations.
In algorithm 20.1, the final estimation of the camera matrices takes place in the
domain of the original point measurements. As an alternative, one could apply a DLT
algorithm in the dual domain, as in the basic algorithm of section 20.1.1. However, the
present method seems simpler. It has the advantage of avoiding the need for applying
the inverse transformations T, T′, T′′. More significantly the final computation of the
camera matrices is carried out using the original data. This is important, because the
transformations can severely skew the noise characteristics of the data.
The basis for this algorithm and the n-view case to follow is the dual fundamental
20.2 Reduced reconstruction 511
Objective Given a set of six point correspondences xj ↔ x′
j ↔ x′′
j across three views, compute
a reconstruction from these points, consisting of the three camera matrices P, P′ and P′′
and the six 3D points X1, . . . ,X6.
Algorithm
(i) Select a set of four points no three of which are collinear in any of the three views. Let
these be the correspondences x2+k ↔ x′
2+k ↔ x′′
2+k for k = 1, . . . , 4.
(ii) For the first view, find a projective transformation T that maps each x2+k to ek. Apply
T to the other two points x1 and x2 resulting in points ˆx1 = Tx1 and ˆx2 = Tx2.
(iii) From the dual correspondence ˆx1 ↔ ˆx2 derive an equation in the entries p, q, r, s, t
of the reduced fundamental matrix ˆF as in (20.4). The equation is derived from the
relationship ˆx
T
2 ˆFˆx1 = 0.
(iv) In the same way as in the last two steps, form two more equations from the points in the
other two views. This results in a set of three homogeneous equations in five unknowns.
There will be a two-parameter family of solutions for the reduced fundamental matrix,
generated by two independent solutions ˆF1 and ˆF2.
(v) The general solution is ˆF = ˆF1 + μˆF2. From the requirement det ˆF = 0 one derives a
homogeneous cubic equation in (, μ), which one may solve to find (, μ), and hence
ˆF. There will be 1 or 3 real solutions. Further steps are applied to each solution in turn.
(vi) Use the method of section 20.2.3 to extract the parameters (a, b, c, d)T of the second
reduced camera matrix ˆP
′
defined in (20.5).
(vii) We complete the reconstruction in the original measurement domain. The dual of camera
ˆP
′
defined by (a, b, c, d) is the point X2 = (a, b, c, d)T. Thus the six 3D points are
X1 = (1, 1, 1, 1)T, X2 = (a, b, c, d)T andX2+k = Ek for k = 1, . . . , 4. This gives the
structure of the reconstructed scene. One may then compute the three camera matrices
using the DLT algorithm for camera calibration described in section 7.1(p178). Since
we require the camera matrices defined with respect to the original camera coordinates
here, we use the original coordinates to solve for P, P′ and P′′ such that PXj = xj , etc.
Since the solution will be exact, the DLT solution will be sufficient.

matrix, ˆF. Note how the dual fundamental matrix expresses a relationship between
points in the same image. Indeed the equations used to solve for ˆF are constructed
from points in the same image. This contrasts with the standard fundamental matrix
where the relationships being encoded are between points seen in separate images.
20.2.5 Six points in n views
The method for six points in three views can be applied with little modification to the
case of six points in many views. The main difference is that the reduced fundamental
matrix ˆF will be uniquely determined by the data. Specifically at step 4 of the algorithm
of section 20.2.4, each view will contribute one equation. With four views or more, this
will be sufficient to determine ˆF.
In this redundant-data case, one must be careful with the effects of noise. For this
reason, it appears preferable to carry out the last step of the algorithm, as shown, with
original untransformed points. This mitigates the effect of noise distortion that would
result from working with transformed points.

20.2.6 Seven points in n views
The problem of seven points in n views is dual to the case of three views of n+4 points
and is solved by computing the reduced trifocal tensor from n point correspondences.
Definition 20.6. A trifocal tensor T is called a reduced trifocal tensor if it satisfies
the linear constraints imposed by synthetic point correspondences ek ↔ e′
k ↔ e′′
k for
i = 1, . . . , 4.
The general method for reconstruction from 7 points is similar to the method for six
points in n views, except that the reduced trifocal tensor is used instead of the reduced
fundamental matrix. There are, however some minor differences.
In computing the reduced trifocal tensor, the constraints corresponding to the synthetic
correspondences ej ↔ ej ↔ ej should be satisfied exactly, whereas the other
correspondences used to compute the tensor are subject to noise, and will only be satisfied
approximately. Otherwise the computed tensor will not be exactly in reduced
form. In the case of the reduced fundamental matrix this was handled by giving a specific
parametrization of the reduced fundamental matrix. That is, it was parametrized
in such a way that the constraints generated by the synthetic correspondences were automatically
satisfied (see (20.4)). In the case of the trifocal tensor, it is not obvious that
such a convenient parametrization is possible. The synthetic constraints are of the form
eiepeqǫjprǫkqsT jk
i = 0rs
which is rather more complicated than the linear constraints on the reduced fundamental
matrix. Instead, one may proceed in the following manner.
In the usual linear method of computing the trifocal tensor, one must solve a set of
linear equations of the form At = 0, or more precisely, find the vector t that minimizes
kAtk subject to ktk = 1. In solving for the reduced trifocal tensor, the matrix
A may be divided into two parts, corresponding to those constraints from the synthetic
correspondences, which should be satisfied exactly, and the constraints from real correspondences,
which must be satisfied in a least-squares sense. The first set of constraints
are of the form Ct = 0, and the second set may be written as ˆAt = 0. The problem
becomes: find t that minimizes kˆAtk subject to ktk = 1 and Ct = 0. An algorithm for
solving this problem is given as algorithm A5.5(p594).
For the problem of extracting the three camera matrices from the reduced tensor no
simple method seems to be available, similar to that described in section 20.2.3 for the
fundamental matrix. Instead, one may use the method described in steps 5 and 6 of the
general dual algorithm (see page 505).
The minimal configuration of this type is seven points in two views. In this case, the
problem is best solved directly by the method of section 11.1.2(p281), rather than by
dualization to the case of three points in six views.
20.2.7 Performance issues
Dual reconstruction algorithms based on the reduced fundamental matrix and trifocal
tensor have been implemented and tested. The results of these tests were contained
20.3 Closure 513
in a student report presented in August 1996 by Gilles Debunne. Since this report is
effectively unavailable, the results are summarized here.
The most serious difficulty is the distortion of the noise distribution by the application
of projective transformations Ti to the images. Application of projective transformations
to the image data has the effect of distorting any noise distribution that may
apply to the data. The problem is related to the need to choose four points that are noncollinear
in any of the images. If the points are close to collinear in any of the images,
then the projective transformation applied to the image in step 1 of the algorithm may
entail extreme distortion of the image. This sort of distortion can degrade performance
of the algorithm severely.
Without special attention being paid to the noise-distortion, performance of the algorithms
was generally unsatisfactory, Despite great care being taken to minimize errors
due to noise in steps 4–6 of the algorithm (page 505ff), when the inverse projective
transformations are applied in step 7, the average error became very large. Some points
retained quite small error, whereas in those images where distortion was significant,
quite large errors resulted.
Normalization in the sense of section 4.4.4(p107) is also a problem. It has been
shown to be essential for performance of the linear reconstruction algorithms to apply
data normalization. However, what sort of normalization should be applied to the
transformed data of figure 20.1(right), which is geometrically unrelated to actual image
measurements, is a mystery.
To get good results, it would seem that one would need to propagate assumed error
distributions forward in step 1 of the algorithm to get assumed error distributions for
the transformed data figure 20.1(right), and then during reconstruction to minimize
residual error relative to this propagated error distribution. Equivalently, cost functions
being minimized during reconstruction must be related back to measurement error in
the original image points. Recent work reported in [Hartley-00a, Schaffalitzky-00c]
has shown that this indeed gives significantly improved results.
20.3 Closure
20.3.1 The literature
The idea behind Carlsson–Weinshall duality was first described in a pair of papers appearing
simultaneously: [Carlsson-95] andWeinshall [Weinshall-95] and subsequently
in a joint paper [Carlsson-98]. The treatment given here for the general method of dualizing
an algorithm was given in [Hartley-98b], derived from these earlier papers.
Details of methods for handling with noise propagation were given in [Hartley-00a],
building on earlier implementations contained in an unavailable report by Gilles Debunne
(August 1996).
The problem of reconstruction from six points in three views was perhaps first treated
in a technical report [Hartley-92b] (later published as [Hartley-94c]) where the existence
of up to eight solutions was shown. The problem was given a complete solution
in [Quan-94] where it was shown that only three solutions are possible. This was also
pointed out in [Ponce-94]. The paper [Carlsson-95] established that this problem is
514 20 Duality
dual to the two-view, seven point problem for which a solution was known. This enabled
the formulation of the method given in this chapter. The minimum six point
configuration was used in [Torr-97] for robust estimation of the trifocal tensor. An alternative
method for computing a reconstruction from six points in n ≥ 3 views is given
in [Schaffalitzky-00c]. This method does not require that images are first projectively
transformed to a canonical basis.
20.3.2 Notes and Exercises
(i) In the dual algorithm of section 20.1.1 it was noted that the method will only
work if the four points used to define the image transformations are noncoplanar.
However, note that in this case, the algorithm of section 18.5.2(p450)
will compute a projective reconstruction linearly.
(ii) If the four chosen points are coplanar, then the homographies Ti will map the
plane to a common coordinate system. The transformed points x′i
j will then
satisfy the condition of section 17.5.2(p425), namely the lines joining any pair
of points x′i
j and x′i
k (j and k fixed and a different line for each i) will meet in a
common point. The duality in the case is described in [Criminisi-98, Irani-98].
(iii) Still in the case of the four chosen points being coplanar: after applying the Ti,
any point on the plane of the four points will map to the same point in all images.
Thus, the fundamental matrix consistent with the point correspondences
will be skew-symmetric. -->
